# Convolutional neural network with keras
This is my first convolutional neural network made with keras. The example is from the book "Deep learning with python"
The objective of the network is to identify if the picture is of a  dog or a cat-
Along the notebook, we're going to see many models, but the last one is the model that has the best accuracy on the validation test (93%).
In the last network we use a pretrained model (because the amount of pictures is not enough to generalization),  fine-tuning on the pretrained model, data augmentation.

## This is the result
